## How to install:

UPDATES ARE NOT TO BE EXPECTED AS THIS ADDON WAS MADE AS A QUICK AFTERNOON ADDON.

1. To install this addon, simply drag the blueannoucements.blueprint file into your Pterodactyl directory. [your Pterodactyl directory will typically be /var/www/pterodactyl].
2. Run the commands, "cd /var/www/pterodactyl" and "blueprint -i blueannoucements" Blueprint will now install Blue Annoucements.
3. Your installation should now be completed.
